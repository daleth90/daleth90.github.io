I am an experienced Unity developer with **8 years of experience**, specializing in **gameplay mechanics** and **software architecture**. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in **tool development**, **multiplayer systems**, and **network programming**. Apart from Unity, I also have experience in backend languages like **Golang** and **Java**.

Being a natural **problem solver**, I excel at identifying and resolving code issues, and engage in **performance optimization** to ensure game experiences. As a collaborative team player, I believe in **effective collaboration** and **share my opinions** with the team, in order to create better products.

***If you're interested in my experiences, feel free to contact me!***
